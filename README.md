This is a school project. In this project I'm making a basic JavaFX code which produces a screen with several details you can fill in to submit for IT help.

The app contains two menu items for 3 pages: Informatie, Aanmelden, DorpsgenotenInfo.
When you press on either one of the screen will fill with the corresponding action.

Aanmeldenpage contains a couple textfields, which can be edited, like: Name, date of birth, telephone number etc. 
Once submitting your details they will be send to a database and the fields will be cleared for another signup.
See picture below.

Informatiepage contains some information about the uses of the application.

Last but not least there, the DorpsgenotenInfo page. This page contains a listview and buttons for updating and deleting participants.
See picture below.

The Aanmeldenpage and DorpsgenotenInfopage are both linked to a database. This database will contain all the details about the participants.
See picture below.

Have fun reading my code. 
And thank you for reading!
