# ICTHulp
This is a school project. In this project I'm making a basic JavaFX code which produces a screen with several details you can fill in to submit for IT help.

The app contains two menu items for 2 pages, Aanmelden and Informatie.
When you press on either one of the screen will fill with the corresponding action.

For aanmelden, you will see a couple textfields, which can be edited, like: Name, date of birth, telephone number etc.
For informatie, you will see more information about the day.

Once submitting your details they will be send to a database and the fields will be cleared for another signup.
